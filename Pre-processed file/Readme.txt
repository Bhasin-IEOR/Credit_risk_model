Due to limitations on file size while uploading on GitHub the training data file i.e. train_data.csv is zipped in a folder.
This file needs to be extracted/unzipped before using further in the codes.
The data files in this folder are not raw data files and they are resulted after exclusive exploratory data analysis, statistical testing and other data pre-processing and data cleaning processes.
